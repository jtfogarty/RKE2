1. Definition: It's defined in the `all.yaml` file as:

```yaml
rancher_hostname: "rancher.docure.ai"
```

2. Usage: This variable is used in the `roles/apply-manifests/tasks/main.yaml` file when deploying Rancher using Helm. Specifically, it's used in the "Deploy Rancher" task:

```yaml
- name: Deploy Rancher
  kubernetes.core.helm:
    kubeconfig: "/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml"
    name: rancher
    chart_ref: rancher-latest/rancher
    release_namespace: cattle-system
    create_namespace: true
    values:
      hostname: "{{ rancher_hostname }}"
      replicas: 3
```

3. Purpose: The `rancher_hostname` variable sets the hostname that will be used to access the Rancher management interface. It's important because:
   - It determines the URL you'll use to access Rancher.
   - It's used for SSL/TLS certificate generation.
   - It's crucial for proper routing and access to the Rancher UI.

4. Configuration: You should set this variable to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that resolves to your Rancher server's IP address or load balancer. For example, "rancher.mycompany.com".

5. DNS Configuration: Ensure that you have set up DNS records to point this hostname to the appropriate IP address (likely your load balancer or the IP of your first server node).

6. SSL Considerations: If you're using Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates, this hostname needs to be publicly resolvable.

To properly set up Rancher, you should modify the `rancher_hostname` variable in the `inventory/group_vars/all.yaml` file to match your desired Rancher access URL before running the playbook.
